i have stored user input in a string called name.
i tried giving Response.Write("window.open('pdf1/'+document.getElementById(name).Value+'.pdf','_blank')")
it's not working.

Try this
if name declared server side
Response.Write("window.open('pdf1/'+<%=name%>+'.pdf','_blank')")

if name declared client side
Response.Write("window.open('pdf1/'+name+'.pdf','_blank')")
